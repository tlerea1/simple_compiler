HW4:

This assignment we added declaration handling and creation of
the symbol table. This was achieved by modifing the already existing
recursive decent functions to add values to the symbol table. 
Additionally, a new interface and two implementing classes were added,
visitors. They are in charge of generating the output for the
symbol table, when the -t option is chosen. The Graphical Parser
uses identityHashCodes to uniquely identify all objects, and
maintains a set of all predefined Types as to not re-define them.

HW3:

I have built the initial part of the parser for this assignment.
I used the recursive decent process described in lecture. If a 
failure is encountered a ParserException is thrown. The parser
calls all() from the scanner and then uses the list of tokens
to peak when needed and advance through the tokens when needed.
The parser also uses the observer sceme. An observer as defined
by the interface has three functions, decend, accend, and add. 
decend and accend essentially allow the observer to maintain a
stack trace. Add adds a new thing to the observer. The add function
is overloaded the String param is for non-terminals, while the Token
param is for the terminals. 

HW 2:

I have built the scanner and main driver the the SIMPLE compiler.
The scanner has two levels. The low level file reading, and the
higher level token parsing. The parsing uses a String buffer that
is generated by the file reading. The functions peak and nextChar
use the low level file reading seemlessly so that the parsing need
not care about the state of the buffer. A -1 is carried up through
the chain of functions when there is nothing left to read from the 
stream. The tokens that are generated contain the positioning of the
token in the source code as well as the type and original source code
text. The next function returns the next available token in the stream,
while the all function returns all tokens from the stream. next will 
return an EOF token when the end of the stream has been reached, while
all simply returns a Collection<Token>.
