I built the three cats in Python, JAVA, and C. JAVA was the easiest for me
all I needed to do was find a lower level buffered stream class and then I
was all set. Python took a bit of work and looking up since I am not too 
familiar with the language. But I ended up getting it to work. C gave me
the most trouble, but after changing the fd from stdin to 0 and stdout to 1
everything seemed to work exactly as I expected it. perhaps stdin is defined
as a FILE*. Just use standard javac to compile the JAVA program. I have
included a makefile for the C program. The Python program is written for
Python 2.7.
