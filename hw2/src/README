I have built the scanner and main driver the the SIMPLE compiler.
The scanner has two levels. The low level file reading, and the
higher level token parsing. The parsing uses a String buffer that
is generated by the file reading. The functions peak and nextChar
use the low level file reading seemlessly so that the parsing need
not care about the state of the buffer. A -1 is carried up through
the chain of functions when there is nothing left to read from the 
stream. The tokens that are generated contain the positioning of the
token in the source code as well as the type and original source code
text. The next function returns the next available token in the stream,
while the all function returns all tokens from the stream. next will 
return an EOF token when the end of the stream has been reached, while
all simply returns a Collection<Token>.
